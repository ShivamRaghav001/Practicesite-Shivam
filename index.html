    State your name and relevant background: Introduce yourself by stating your name and a brief background on your education, experience and skills relevant to the position.

    Show enthusiasm and interest: Express your enthusiasm and interest in the position and the company. This can show the interviewer that you are motivated and excited about the opportunity.
